A vague path leads through the tall grass and weeds. Towering trees rise to the north. 
Sounds of a town echo from the South.

A dense cover of trees blocks most light from entering. Tall plants and strange sounds 
surround the area. Said to be the home of the monsterous Simwel: a vicious creature that 
will prey on any living thing that enters. A grassy path leads back to the light in the south.

A cobblestone path to the south leads into the heart of the city, but it is blocked by a larged, locked gate. Inside, children play and merchants tell customers about their goods. A grassy path to the north dissapears into the distance.
